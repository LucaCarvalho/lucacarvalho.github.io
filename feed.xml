                    <p>Back in 2018, my Introduction to Programming professor assigned me (and my class) an interesting project: implementing an 8-puzzle game in C. Following his recommendation, I used SDL2 to implement graphics and input handling.</p>
<p>Turns out, it was quite fun to code it! I had never worked with SDL (or anything similar) before, so I had to learn the basics from the ground up. It took me a couple of weeks, but I managed to write something reasonably elegant that worked pretty well.</p>

                    This is my first post. I'm not entirely sure what to talk about, so I'll make it the most useless post of this blog. Yaay!
